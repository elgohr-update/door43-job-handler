# Door43-Job-Handler

This (shorter) README is for the Docker Hub long description.

This container is part of tX translationConverter platform initiated by a commit to
the DCS (Door43 Content Service) at [door43.org](https://door43.org/).

See [here](https://forum.ccbt.bible/t/door43-org-tx-development-architecture/65)
for a diagram of the overall flow of the tx (translationConverter) platform.

This program accepts conversion jobs from a rq/redis queue (placed there by the
[door43-enqueue-job](https://github.com/unfoldingWord-dev/door43-enqueue-job)) program.
